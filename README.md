Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.


## Steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11.

### System Requirements

Ensure your system meets the basic requirements:
- **Storage**: Less than 200 MB for download, disk footprint of less than 500 MB.
- **Hardware**: Visual Studio Code is lightweight and should run smoothly on modern hardware.

## Download Visual Studio Code

Visit the [official Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) to download the latest version.

There are two main ways to install Visual Studio Code on Windows:
- Using the installer.
- Extracting the zip archive.

### Using the Installer

1. **Download the Installer**:
    - Go to the Visual Studio Code [download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
    - Download the `VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe` file.

2. Step 1: Download Visual Studio Installer
## Step 1: Open Web Browser
1. **Launch your preferred web browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## Step 2: Go to the Visual Studio Website
2. **Navigate to the official Visual Studio download page** by entering the URL: [Visual Studio Website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

## Step 3: Select Version
3. **Choose the edition** you want to install:
   - **Visual Studio Community**: Free for individual developers, open-source projects, academic research, education, and small professional teams.
   - **Visual Studio Professional**: For small teams with advanced features (requires a paid license).
   - **Visual Studio Enterprise**: For larger teams with advanced features (requires a paid license).

## Step 4: Run the Visual Studio Installer
4. **Run the Installer**:
   - Once the installer file is downloaded, open it. You might need to allow the installer to make changes to your device.
   - Click the downloaded file in your web browser (often located in the bottom left corner of the window).
   - If prompted by User Account Control, click "Yes" to allow the installer to run.
